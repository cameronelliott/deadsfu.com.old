### Start the SFU:

You should have a `deadsfu` or `deadsfu.exe`, or 
be pulled the Docker image.



{{< tabs name="runtab" >}} 
{{< tab name="Linux or macOS" codelang="bash" >}}
# you can use your name+number if you like
./deadsfu https://cameron42.ddns5.com:8443
{{< /tab >}}}
{{< tab name="Windows" codelang="bash" >}}
# you can use your name+number if you like
./deadsfu.exe https://cameron42.ddns5.com:8443
{{< /tab >}}}
{{{< tab name="Using Docker" codelang="bash" >}}
docker run --network host x186k/deadsfu /app/main https://cameron42.ddns5.com:8443
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Wait for the HTTPS-certificate to be aquired:
  




The first time aquiring the cert it can take a little while.  
Usually it takes under 10 seconds, although it can take up to 30 seconds.  
Please re-use hostnames when possible, this will save you time from waiting, and reduce our load.

### Your SFU is now ready to use.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ’¡" text="You can use whatever hostname you want in front of .ddns5.com, but it will save you trouble if you choose a word unlikley to be used by other people. It will also save you time, if you keep re-using the same set of hostnames. We suggest a set of less than ten (hostnames) to be gracious." />}}



## Open Browser to Send/Receive Page

With the SFU running, copy the following URL and open it in your browser
```
https://cameron42.ddns5.com
```

## Start Transmitting

Open one browser tab to the URL you copied.

You should have a camera connected to your system for transmission.

Hit the `Send` button.

You should see video of yourself as captured from your camera.

This video is being sent to the SFU and ready for distribution.

## Start Receiving

Open one, two, or three browser tabs to the URL you copied.

In each, hit the `Receive` button.

In a second or two, you should see video being relayed from the SFU.

## Try Simulcast

By default when you send, you are sending using Simulcast, this means the sending-tab
is encoding and sending three different levels of video.

You change which of the three simulcast channels you are viewing by using the `Channel` drop down.

## Next Steps

The next step is really seeing how you can scale your video broadcast beyond a single SFU.

Coming soon!
