# Partial and Full deadsfu.com website source code

On Github is a *partial* copy of the sources for the website.

The section below has a link on how to download the *whole* sources
including the many binary images and videos which don't belong in a
git repo.


## Important: where to get the full sources for this website

Because I keep large images and *videos* in this repo,
the Github repo does not contain all files.
Files in static/binaries are excluded from Github.
There are important images and videos in there. 


You can download the *whole* original source file-set here:

If you plan on working on or extending the DeadSFU website, 
please save a copy for posterity's sake.
